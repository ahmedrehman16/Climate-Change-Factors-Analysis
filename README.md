Data Analysis and Visualization of Climate Change Factors using Power BI

## Problem Statement

Climate change has been a very big issue in developing countries like Pakistan due to a number of different factor. The main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. When burnt, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide into the air, causing the planet to heat up. 

## Data Set 
Contains data from the World Bank's data portal

## MyStory

Story starts from **1990**, where we have the total population of Pakistan around **11 crores** and goes 
to **2015** where it has jumped to **19 crores** after nearly **80%** increase. Correlated to that, the Urban
Population jumps to an even higher near **110%** increase showing a large number of people shifted from
rural to Urban Areas due to a number of reasons. 

With the increase in the Urban population, we see a 
**decline in the Forest Land** in Pakistan with passing years, which shows that deforestation was carried 
out to accommodate such a large increase in Urban population and cities had to outgrow their limits and 
acquire the surrounding land. With the advancement in Urban cities and increase development
processes and industrial plantation in the Urban areas, the emission of CO2, carbon related, and other 
harmful gases were seen to **rise up to a very alarming level** as shown by the stats.

Keeping in view these stats and analysis, in the previous some years, Pakistan has somehow controlled 
the CO2 emission due to the industrial factors up to some extent, but it is still lagging behind in cheap 
and clean energy production as fossil fuels is the main source of its energy generation as the visuals 
explain. So, in context with **Climate Action SDG**, which states that one should Take urgent action to 
combat climate change and its impacts, Pakistani Government needs to take steps to ban deforestation and plant more trees and also shift towards using clean and cheap sources for energy production so the 
harmful effects on the climate could be minimized.
